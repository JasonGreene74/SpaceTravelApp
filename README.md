# SpaceTravelApp 🚀

SpaceTravelApp is a React-based application that allows users to explore planets, view spacecrafts, and manage interplanetary missions. The app integrates with the SWAPI API for Star Wars-themed data and includes custom features like creating your own spacecraft and managing decommissioned crafts.

## Features

### 🌌 **Planets**
- View a list of planets from the Star Wars universe.
- Click on a planet to see detailed information, including climate, terrain, population, and more.
- Randomly assigned spacecrafts are displayed for each planet.

### 🚀 **Spacecrafts**
- View a list of available spacecrafts.
- Decommission spacecrafts, which disables them for missions and marks them in red.
- Create your own custom spacecraft and see it added to the list.

### 🛠️ **Create Your Own Craft**
- Design a custom spacecraft by specifying:
  - Name
  - Cargo capacity
  - Passenger capacity
  - Propulsion type
  - Atmospheric entry/departure method
  - Orbit/landing type
- Newly created crafts appear at the top of the Spacecrafts page and are available for missions.

### 🎯 **Mission Control**

  - Departure planet
  - Destination planet
  - Spacecraft
  - Number of passengers
  - Main contact
- Decommissioned spacecrafts are disabled in the dropdown and marked as "Decommissioned."
